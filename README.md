Welcome to Tracking-system-for-larval-zebrafish
======================
Introduction
------------
This tracking system for larval zebrafish is a component of the whole system for whole brain imaging of neural activity in freely behaving larval zebrafish. It is built up by Labview, while the image processing component (fish tracking dll) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) component are written by C++.

Pipeline
----------
1. acquire a frame
2. acquire stage position
3. detect the fish, estimate the heading vector of the fish(fish tracking dll)
4. push fish position, fish heading vector and stage position into corresponding queues
5. estimate command that drives the stage using the history of command, stage position, fish position and fish heading vector(MPC_dll_4)
6. push command into corresponding queue
7. next loop(3ms every loop)

Branches
-------
operant_learning: Branch 'operant_learning' is a branch for the operant learning project. There is an additional communication module to send the tracking results to the stimulation control system. Then the stimulation control system can switch the stimulation according to the fish position relative to the arena and the heading vector of the fish.
